      "HNB FINANCE has been an immense strength to our lives When we turn to a narrow lane at Keppetipola on the Welimada-Nuwara Eliya road, we find the Gawaranmana village. It is a common feature of the Welimada community to make a living by cultivating vegetables and flowers, which is the mainstay of their livelihood.  We stepped into Suji Plant Nursery run by the couple Vipula Kumara Gunaratne and Nilushi Samudrika to hear their story behind the Kapuru Plant Nursery which was developed by this courageous couple. This is Nilushi’s voice: My husband started this nursery. It’s been ten years since the business started. At that time we first took Rs. 5,000 under the Diriya Loan Scheme. As we continued to transact with the Company with trust, we could easily get the loans we needed at the right time. We have taken loans up to Rs. 300,000 beginning from Rs. 100,000 loans.  That is to start a new rose plantation together with another friend in Boralanda. HNB FINANCE has been our financial partner for over 10 years now. Therefore, we have been able do business according to some plan without any hassle. We obtained loans from HNB FINANCE for our business, and recently obtained a leasing facility to buy a three wheeler as well. As traders come to us to buy plants, we don’t have any problem in finding the market. As our income has been good, we hope to buy another plot of land and expand this cultivation very soon. It goes without saying that our friendship with HNB FINANCE has given a great boost to our lives. Nilushi Samudika Keppetipola\n",

      "HNB Finance creates an oasis in Mohoththuwarama Primary School HNB Finance creates oasis in Mohoththuwarama Primary School Sri Lanka’s leading integrated financial service provider HNB Finance established a water purification system and renovated the Mohoththuwarama Primary School in Kalpitiya as a part of its sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. In addition to setting up a water purification system, a much-needed facility for the school and by extension the village of Mohoththuwarama facing a dire scarcity of drinking water, HNB Finance also renovated the main building, put up a name board and created the school logo and flag. “As a financial services provider in a market saturated by such institutions, we believe our success is deeply intertwined with the development of our customers and the respective societies they are a part of. The smallest step taken towards making this mission a reality is an accomplishment that has not only allowed us to create a lasting bond with the residents of Mohoththuwarama but also ensure some of their most basic utilities are ensured for,” HNB Finance Managing Director Chief executive officer Chaminda Prabath said. Situated far from the Kalpitiya town in the peninsula, the village consisting approximately of 150 families whose 47 children attend the only primary school in the village conducting classes from Grade 1 to 5, has long suffered a scarcity of drinking water due to the high minerals present in the soil. The only serviceable natural water resources, a well in the school, is heavy with minerals for a greater part of the year. “The scarcity of drinking water has been an issue for this village for a long time now. Even though we have taken this issue to every possible local government officer and representatives we were not given a permanent solution. We are grateful that HNB Finance came forward to help us in this hour of need, they went beyond what we hoped for, a sustainable water purification system, and also lent a hand in renovating the school through which we hope to expand our services,” Principal of Mohothtuwarama Primary School Dinesh Kumararatne said. Established with the assistance of the school staff and villagers, the water purification system is just one project taken up by the HNB Finance under its sustainable CSR initiative. Established in 2000, HNB Finance PLC is licensed as a registered Finance Company by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Maintaining an extensive island-wide presence across 48 branches and 21service Centers with the power of Hatton National Bank’s 650 ATM machines, HNB Finance has over the recent past expanded into new fields of business and now offers Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Loans in addition to savings, gold loans, fixed deposits facilities and leasing products.\n",

Annual Report 2023/2024 Throughout history, great leaders have emphasized the power of simplification. By focusing on the essentials, we strengthen our core abilities and pave the way for sustained success.

In addition, the Company pushed ahead with key investments for the future, pursuing strategic initiatives and expanding its footprint.

      "I enjoy the benefit of obtaining money for the business while saving His name is L.T.G. Anthony. It was many years ago that Anthony found a job at a wheel alignment shop. That was his first job. This young man, after working there for several years, left for a job in Korea realizing that he will not achieve any success by working under others. Anthony, who returned to Sri Lanka after working in Korea, tried to fulfill his dream of running his own business by starting a small wheel alignment shop in Mahawatta area. This is what he told us about it: Soon after I had started the business, an officer from HNB FINANCE came to my shop; that was to open a savings account with HNB FINANCE. I opened a savings account with HNB FINANCE that day because of the very benefits I get through that savings account. I didn’t have to waste my time to deposit money in the account. An officer from HNB FINANCE came to my shop every evening to collect the deposit money. I set aside a part of my daily income for savings; so I was able to save a considerable amount of money very quickly. As I was able to get a loan without any guarantors through Swashakthi Savings, I was able to easily get the money I needed for my business in time. Accordingly, I was able to get a loan of Rs.100,000 first, and Rs.400,000 on four occasions very easily. Even when the loan is repaid, an official of the company comes to the shop to collect the instalments; so I have the advantage of repaying the loan instalments without having to spend my time without even realizing it.

      "Sri Lanka’s leading integrated financial service provider HNB Finance established a water purification system and renovated the Mohoththuwarama Primary School in Kalpitiya as a part of its sustainable Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. In addition to setting up a water purification system, a much-needed facility for the school and by extension the village of Mohoththuwarama facing a dire scarcity of drinking water, HNB Finance also renovated the main building, put up a name board and created the school logo and flag. “As a financial services provider in a market saturated by such institutions, we believe our success is deeply intertwined with the development of our customers and the respective societies they are a part of. The smallest step taken towards making this mission a reality is an accomplishment that has not only allowed us to create a lasting bond with the residents of Mohoththuwarama but also ensure some of their most basic utilities are ensured for,” HNB Finance Managing Director Chief executive officer Chaminda Prabath said. Situated far from the Kalpitiya town in the peninsula, the village consisting approximately of 150 families whose 47 children attend the only primary school in the village conducting classes from Grade 1 to 5, has long suffered a scarcity of drinking water due to the high minerals present in the soil. The only serviceable natural water resources, a well in the school, is heavy with minerals for a greater part of the year. “The scarcity of drinking water has been an issue for this village for a long time now. Even though we have taken this issue to every possible local government officer and representatives we were not given a permanent solution. We are grateful that HNB Finance came forward to help us in this hour of need, they went beyond what we hoped for, a sustainable water purification system, and also lent a hand in renovating the school through which we hope to expand our services,” Principal of Mohothtuwarama Primary School Dinesh Kumararatne said. Established with the assistance of the school staff and villagers, the water purification system is just one project taken up by the HNB Finance under its sustainable CSR initiative. Established in 2000, HNB Finance PLC is licensed as a registered Finance Company by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Maintaining an extensive island-wide presence across 48 branches and 21service Centers with the power of Hatton National Bank’s 650 ATM machines, HNB Finance has over the recent past expanded into new fields of business and now offers Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Loans in addition to savings, gold loans, fixed deposits facilities and leasing products.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
