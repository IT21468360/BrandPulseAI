This is Nilushi’s voice: My husband started this nursery. It’s been ten years since the business started. At that time we first took Rs. 5,000 under the Diriya Loan Scheme. As we continued to transact with the Company with trust, we could easily get the loans we needed at the right time.

In addition to setting up a water purification system, a much-needed facility for the school and by extension the village of Mohoththuwarama facing a dire scarcity of drinking water, HNB Finance also renovated the main building, put up a name board and created the school logo and flag. “As a financial services provider in a market saturated by such institutions, we believe our success is deeply intertwined with the development of our customers and the respective societies they are a part of. The smallest step taken towards making this mission a reality is an accomplishment that has not only allowed us to create a lasting bond with the residents of Mohoththuwarama but also ensure some of their most basic utilities are ensured for,” HNB Finance Managing Director Chief executive officer Chaminda Prabath said. Situated far from the Kalpitiya town in the peninsula, the village consisting approximately of 150 families whose 47 children attend the only primary school in the village conducting classes from Grade 1 to 5, has long suffered a scarcity of drinking water due to the high minerals present in the soil. The only serviceable natural water resources, a well in the school, is heavy with minerals for a greater part of the year. “The scarcity of drinking water has been an issue for this village for a long time now. Even though we have taken this issue to every possible local government officer and representatives we were not given a permanent solution. We are grateful that HNB Finance came forward to help us in this hour of need, they went beyond what we hoped for, a sustainable water purification system, and also lent a hand in renovating the school through which we hope to expand our services,” Principal of Mohothtuwarama Primary School Dinesh Kumararatne said.

Anthony. It was many years ago that Anthony found a job at a wheel alignment shop. That was his first job. This young man, after working there for several years, left for a job in Korea realizing that he will not achieve any success by working under others. Anthony, who returned to Sri Lanka after working in Korea, tried to fulfill his dream of running his own business by starting a small wheel alignment shop in Mahawatta area. This is what he told us about it: Soon after I had started the business, an officer from HNB FINANCE came to my shop; that was to open a savings account with HNB FINANCE. I opened a savings account with HNB FINANCE that day because of the very benefits I get through that savings account. I didn’t have to waste my time to deposit money in the account. An officer from HNB FINANCE came to my shop every evening to collect the deposit money. I set aside a part of my daily income for savings; so I was able to save a considerable amount of money very quickly. As I was able to get a loan without any guarantors through Swashakthi Savings, I was able to easily get the money I needed for my business in time. Accordingly, I was able to get a loan of Rs.100,000 first, and Rs.400,000 on four occasions very easily. Even when the loan is repaid, an official of the company comes to the shop to collect the instalments; so I have the advantage of repaying the loan instalments without having to spend my time without even realizing it.
