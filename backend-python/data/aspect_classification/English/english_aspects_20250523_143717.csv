"The Fed policy is theft, despite what this propaganda says. Their guilt is active, not passive. When you increase money, it is theft.",Others,2024-05-14T05:18:35Z
"almost every time to much money ends up in the hands of the so called guardians of the asset , they start treating it as shit  and anyone who owns a tiny bit of money is punished maximum . And from a point of view of fining crimes , financial crimes are the easyest to cash for lots lesser cost than chasing  the micro money owners.",Trust and Security,2024-05-07T10:08:40Z

"Humans work is the real source of wealth. The facts described here -in my opinion-are just pieces of a puzzle and the ""greater picture"" is to finance the AI capabilities of the New Millennium to enslave all humans. Get one or two good people and expose them to violations of privacy while simultaneously challenge the structure of power created and financed to enslave secretly. The mission was to ""improve"" algorithms of slavery...if a certified medical doctor in the United States does not find access to any decent job -even during a pandemic-if all decent credit is denied to a person in all 50 States of the United States, and then if the same person is exposed to multiple unprovoked assaults by the police (George Floyd's like assaults)...then you know you have created the ALGORITHMS to enslave virtually anyone...even elected judges and leaders.",Loans and Credit Services,2024-05-04T09:56:02Z

"Why shouldn't they take drug money?  Someone has to have the guts to provide the needed drugs.  Why blame the dealers?  And if you do, at least don't blame the legit banks they use for their deposits.  What's next, blaming the tellers at the bank?  The plumbers who fix the toilets in the bank?

  Since we don't have $10,000 bills anymore, these poor dealers have to keep their money in shipping containers.",Trust and Security,2024-05-03T03:34:15Z
