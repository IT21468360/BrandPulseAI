"""If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered.... I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.""

What about corporate banking?,Others,2023-01-12T04:18:09Z
"Commercial Banks also called Corporate Banks also sell services to huge corporations in terms of transfers of money and deposits but also in terms of Loan, so you are wrong when you tell they serve just mid sized companies. 

Also in terms of Risks, since commercial banks deal with money directly they have  huge risks, especially in terms of loan given to corporates and mid sized companies. 

Here the financial analysis needs to be done in details with the right vertical and horizontal analysis and the right financial and performance Ratios.

Bad loans can lead commercial banks to default.",Others,2022-12-30T12:43:42Z
