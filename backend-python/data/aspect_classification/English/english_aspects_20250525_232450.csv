"Banks should only be allowed to lend the amount of money they have from depositors.
The banks lend money to debtors from depositors cash savings.  The debtor pays say 5.5% interest plus the principal to the bank and the bank pays 4% interest to the depositor with the principal going back into the safe ready to pay any cash demands from depositors.
If the bank needs more money to lend out (or to repay depositors) than it has from deposits on hand,  it can go to the central bank and borrow money from that bank and pay them interest and principal to return the money.  The central bank can either print money or get money from foreign governments or large institutions who have bought treasuries with a particular interest rate of return.
The central bank can increase the money supply in accordance with the value of the resources that have been extracted from the ground or oceans, etc, and from the work output (sweat equity) from people.  Equity gets locked up with the purchase of buildings and infrastructure and the amount of cash circulating is a measure of the difference between total economic output, equity that is locked up in bricks and mortar, and the rest is cash to circulate in the economy to facilitate the transactions of goods and services.

Money created out of thin air simply caused the value of money to be reduced which, in a word, is inflation, i.e. a house is a house regardless of the present dollar value of that house.  I bought a house thirty years ago for $100,000, today it's cash value is $1M, but it is the same house.","Transaction, Payments and Accounts",2025-04-15T14:01:58Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']
