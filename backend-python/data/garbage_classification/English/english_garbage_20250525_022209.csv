I think the first few parts of the story can still work with the money multiplier but I agree that the facrt a lot of countries set the reserve requirement to zero means money creation can just go into infinity along with on demand reserves.,,2025-04-09T02:04:59Z

"I think I understand the refutation, but from what I understand, its not at the main point of the money multiplier effect.  This argument doesn't refute that money is created and loaned again and again (the money does multiply!).  All it basically says is the the reserve requirement is not the true limit to the effect - the effect is still there!

However, the dollar no longer equates to an inch, but instead because of the added units, equates to 1/3rd of an inch.   12 inches now equates to $36 dollars.",,2024-02-18T09:40:26Z

"Hey Joeri, thanks for explaining so well. However, isnt there another dimension of multiplying?

The koney banks lend to a company is paid out as wages or saleries or as income for suppliers which in turn spend the money on other companies  goods or workers.

So each Euro or Dollar can be used several times if not saved or taxed away too early.

Shouldn't this determine how much or little circulating money we need to run all required transactions of our economy.
Is this a multiplyer effect?

"I think it's funny you point at the latest text book in economics. Because this time it's really the last word in economics, we promise. Obviously Harris work has it flaws. But all you do is adding more numbers, variables. When in reality economics isn't even a proper science. Like the social ""sciences"" you look at surveys and numbers from the past. And what you bring back is a vast space for interpretation. There is a reason the original Nobel price didn't have a economics category and it was sponsored. I'd be careful with telling people your word is the final word. At the end of the day Harris has his numbers and you have yours. For true understanding you're both likely further away than you hope. Else you got numbers who can predict tomorrow stock prices.",,2023-11-25T08:58:36Z

"Great video! Thank you! Somehow the last point of this wasn't clear to me...

but that ultimatley translates to ""the people feelings about the future"" from the Johnny Harris, that you commented on ->
let me explain:
If not reserve requirements is the limit to the money creation (but still - in the countries with bigger requirements it might be? -> could you confirm/deny that that could ever happen that the teoretical limit from the Money Multipilier Story was ever hit?) than all the individual decisions of the people (if people feel like they want to go for run-bank -> the banks are forced to limit their creation, lowering amount of the money in the economy -> eventually lowering prices/firing people etc.), same with ""loan Demand"" -> if people (or institutions) doesn't feel like the investment is worth their money - they would not lend money and ultimatley the amount of money in the economy would fall as well...


Somehow I just got entirely new light on ""economic news"" -> they have MUCH more power than I ever thought that they actually have. Going against the flow is in fact much harder than I tought (on a macro scale at least, for small average Joes there's still a lot of room to exploit any situation)",,2023-10-06T09:46:08Z
