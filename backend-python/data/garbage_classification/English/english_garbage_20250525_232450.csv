I think the first few parts of the story can still work with the money multiplier but I agree that the facrt a lot of countries set the reserve requirement to zero means money creation can just go into infinity along with on demand reserves.,,2025-04-09T02:04:59Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']
"Money is debt. It means I will pay you. Pay you what? Gold, Silver and copper. Or other resources such as Uranium or Lithium. Money is not a resource. It's a record or a debt to you, or your debt to someone else.",,2025-04-05T21:39:01Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']
"I think I understand the refutation, but from what I understand, its not at the main point of the money multiplier effect.  This argument doesn't refute that money is created and loaned again and again (the money does multiply!).  All it basically says is the the reserve requirement is not the true limit to the effect - the effect is still there!  You could have titled this video ""The money multiplier effect is worse than you thought!"" no?",,2025-04-04T03:48:18Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']

Came here thinking a fundamental misunderstanding when it came to our creation of finance.  Not so.  The steps are semantics.  We are governed by IOUs when it comes to labour and market.  We are torn by the ownership of resources.  Banks can laugh.  Governments can weep.  Exchange will always be with us.,,2025-03-06T16:42:09Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']
"So in summary, the money generation functions exactly like the money multiplier theory says, just by a slightly different mechanism. And the end result is the same.",,2025-03-06T08:48:50Z,Commercial Bank,['commercial bank']
