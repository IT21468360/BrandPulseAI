"Banks should only be allowed to lend the amount of money they have from depositors.
The banks lend money to debtors from depositors cash savings.  The debtor pays say 5.5% interest plus the principal to the bank and the bank pays 4% interest to the depositor with the principal going back into the safe ready to pay any cash demands from depositors.
If the bank needs more money to lend out (or to repay depositors) than it has from deposits on hand,  it can go to the central bank and borrow money from that bank and pay them interest and principal to return the money.  The central bank can either print money or get money from foreign governments or large institutions who have bought treasuries with a particular interest rate of return.
The central bank can increase the money supply in accordance with the value of the resources that have been extracted from the ground or oceans, etc, and from the work output (sweat equity) from people.  Equity gets locked up with the purchase of buildings and infrastructure and the amount of cash circulating is a measure of the difference between total economic output, equity that is locked up in bricks and mortar, and the rest is cash to circulate in the economy to facilitate the transactions of goods and services.

Money created out of thin air simply caused the value of money to be reduced which, in a word, is inflation, i.e. a house is a house regardless of the present dollar value of that house.  I bought a house thirty years ago for $100,000, today it's cash value is $1M, but it is the same house.",2025-04-15T14:01:58Z,en

I think the first few parts of the story can still work with the money multiplier but I agree that the facrt a lot of countries set the reserve requirement to zero means money creation can just go into infinity along with on demand reserves.,2025-04-09T02:04:59Z,en

"I think I understand the refutation, but from what I understand, its not at the main point of the money multiplier effect.

"Maybe I am misunderstanding something and someone can help explain this to me. 

While the reserve requirement may not be entirely accurate, I remember only the rough concept of reserves as one of the constraints that banks have when it comes to their effect on the money supply being taught in university.

This is then used to explore the maths of how much banks can affect the money supply for a given level of reserves or how much the money supply is increased if they manage to increase their capital.

In that sense this oversimplification involving reserve requirements is not entirely accurate, but as a method to explain fractional reserve banking it is more than feasible and does not introduce many issues. I may be completely missing the point here though.",2024-10-29T13:12:23Z,en

4. Meanwhile the bank creates more money and loans it out to others who buy houses.....this in turn creates more demand for houses which drives up the prices of houses.

5. Because house prices are rising due to the bank creating money and loaning it out....the house I am buying from the bank is now worth more....so now the banks asset reserve is growing .... so now the bank can create more money to loan out",2024-07-01T03:06:12Z,en

It would be a myth if the textbooks would make it sound like that's why a run on the bank is so dangerous, because from you 100 euro, there's only 8 euro that still exists and all the rest is gone up in debt-smoke... 

I guess reality of the danger of a bankrun is that the loans are long term contracts and the deposits that immediately follow the loan when the borrower pays his bills and this money gets saved by other people, and this happens with short(er) term contracts, which makes for a dangerous balancing act.

I'd still say that the multiplication increases the risk and makes the entire system basically a joyride towards the next crash.",2024-03-20T21:55:11Z,en

"This videos title is a bit clickbatey to my taste and is grounded in a very pedantic interpretation of most introductory econ textbooks. From econ class I always viewed the multiplier as a function of banks propensity to to give out loans and the reserve requirements merely as a, rarely binding, hard ceiling on what banks will be able to lend out. Whether you call it a bank reserve requiremets, capital requirements or dis/incentivicing loan creation by playing with the interest rate, the effect will be the same as that which you would get from varying reserve requirements. From a pedagogical standpoint I find it perfectly justified to explain the multiplier assuming banks are eager lenders bound only by reserve requirements and add a bunch of caveats about the different forms these lending limitations can take after a simplified understanding of money creation has been established. While I agree completely with everything contained in this video it gave me the false expectation that my understanding of economics was about to be shattered XD. I guess you cant make a living on youtube with nuance XD.
As an economics teacher I would actually stick to the way the multiplier is explained in most textbooks. Yes, its a simplification, but that is really all economics is.
Then in a second step you can add nuance to students understanding, explaining there is more than one way to get banks to hold higher reserves and that by increasing interest rates or capital requirements you can also elicit reactions in the ratio of loans to reserve holdings, in fact banks might constrain the multiplier entirely on their own because they are to afraid to give out loans in an otherwise auspicious monetary environment.

"you keep using that word, i don't think it means what you think it does.

the money multiplier is not a myth. 

it's just the laws were removed requiring banks to keep a fraction of deposits in order to let banks steal more from us.

in usa it was removed after the 2008 crash. in uk in the 80s i think.

the reserve requirements were real. 

and the money multiplier was the old way of putting lending limits on banks to prevent running out of cash and prevent bank runs.

also no bank will go to the central bank for more cash reserves as it is a sign of distress and will result in a massive bank run.

this is why they prefer to use the overnight money markets between themselves..

so fractional reserve laws when they existed did have the money multiplier effect on money supply. and why banks would offer interest to savers so much back in the days.

now with the laws removing fractional reserves and banks being allowed to lend without limits. savings account don't pay anything anymore as banks don't need to keep cash reserves to lend anymore.

so it isn't a myth.

Can and/or does a bank create new money to pay their own employees?,2022-07-18T13:14:53Z,en
"Your belief that Fractional reserve banking  is a myth is wrong itself.  The reason it is wrong is because new money created by the private banks is the same as new money created by the Reserve banks. The real facts are:-  We live in a system of FIAT CREDIT MONEY in almost all economies in the world today. 

The evidence of this is in the fact that money created by central banks is created in the same way as money created by private banks. It is all credit fiat money.
You should look at the explanations of the actual institutions who create new money to see how it is done. The Bank of England has it's clear explanation on their site.
You have said that researchers who work with banks have produced compelling evidence that contradicts the money multiplier BUT you have offered no evidence yourself of what their compelling evidence is. 
However you have offered a short explanation that says a bank owes the customer money and a customer owes the bank money.  This may be so but it ignores the fact that new fiat money has been created which did NOT previously exist.  That fact alone  means more money exists in the system than there was previously despite it being owed between two parties. . 
The very same effect is in operation when the reserve bank creates new money and lends it to the government to spend or anyone else.
 It is all new money created by the bank and lent which has to be paid back simply because it is fiat credit money like al of the sovereign money in countries today. 
  You also say the central bank creates cash. This is a gross exaggeration of the situation because cash is only a very very small percentage of money in todays economies. In some countries it is only 2% and in most less than 5%.  
It is a proven fact that some countries have NO RESERVE requirement at all and have operated this way for over 40 years. 
That alone should  to you that your explanation is wrong.  But it does not prove the concept of fractional reserve banking is wrong.  It only shows that banks being able to get more reserves for fractional reserve lending does mean action of bank lending more is not restricted.",2022-07-15T06:38:41Z,en
Doesn’t the central bank give money but that comes in the cost of over night interest rates for reserve requirements in the deposit window. So the fed is not giving money as much as loaning the money overnight so they have a place to sleep for the night,2022-07-14T22:01:07Z,en

"Great Video! Although one thing I don’t understand is why do define it as banks create money? Wouldn’t it be more correct to say that banks helps to speed up the circulation of money? The key difference is banks don’t have the ability to allow more money to simultaneously exist in the economy at one point in time right? Someone has to save for a loan to be made, simultaneously taking money out of the system and injecting it back into someone else who will actually spend it, thereby help circulate the existing money quicker. Banks cannot make another loan out unless someone saves again right? So from definition point of view, the only entity that truly creates more quantity of money that can be spent in the economy at the same time is through central banks creation of physical money and bank reserves no?",2022-05-24T01:40:13Z,en

"Its correct that the loan itself is made out of thin air, but when he is used to purchase a car, for instance, the car dealer must be paid. If the seller insists on cash payment, the borrower must withdraw the required amount from the bank (Bank A) that granted him the loan in bills and coins. This means the bank must either have that cash on hand or get it from the nearest central bank office. In the first case, it will have to debit its cash holdings. In the second case, it will have to debit its account at the central bank. If the car is purchased with a check drawn on Bank A, the seller will deposit the check with his bank (Bank B). Bank B will then present the check to Bank A for payment, and Bank A will debit its account at the central bank by the amount of the purchase and credit the same amount to Bank B’s account at the central bank. It is only after Bank B acknowledges that its account at the central bank has received the funds from Bank A that the transaction is considered complete",2022-02-03T23:24:46Z,en

Quick Question:  Does this apply to other currencies too? Think inter-country change in reserve currencies like dollars? How is this system managed? 
Ex. Say a Builder from Germany is helping a firm in India build a large dam. The whole deal is being done in dollars. Now can the Indian banks - even the state-run banks (on behalf of the Indian firm) create credit in dollars by just sort of telling the German firm's banks to increase the credit in their accounts?  
If so, why are foreign reserves so important/ what role do they play? Is there a Fractional Reserve Limit on central banks for issuing credit in other currencies?",2022-01-21T05:05:03Z,en

It made me think that Depression-causing bank runs aren't really a problem anymore per se. More so that as you said, if no one wants to borrow because they are afraid of interest rates rising or their ability to pay it back etc., that's when you are actually in trouble. eg. if everyone started avoiding getting mortgages at these insane prices, the demand for owning houses would fall which in theory should push prices down until people start to feel ok getting mortgages again

"Great video! 

Given this information, could you help me clarify these two questions?

1) What motivates banks to attract deposits? I think I understand that when a client moves deposits from bank A to bank B, it corresponds to an increase of B's reserves at the expense of A's reserves, which makes B overall less likely to need to borrow reserves from the central bank (or B can repay some of its current reserve loans). Is there anything else that makes it advantageous to attract deposits?

2) I read elsewhere that banks also create money when they buy bonds (in a similar way as when they make loans). Is that correct? Could you roughly characterize the types of money operations when banks actually create new money, and when they only transfer money?",2021-11-07T20:54:15Z,en

"Banks as corporate persons extend credit to the the individual person ...
Both r legal fictions
The former is licenced by the collective rep( ie govt ) to be the record book keeepr of the fictiinal debt game ..
The individual person is a trust whose trustee and surety is the energy  flesh and blood man or in the case of companies taking loans out the security would be its assets..
The asset for the individual would be the labiur energy ...ie payslips or personal cash flows or personal asset (created from past labour ) pledges..

When the bank keeps the iou as an asset and balances it with a deposit creation (ie iou to the person fiction) its surety is the promise to pay from the trustee of the legal fiction person...
Everything is balanced with the consent of the sovereign ie the flesh and blood man or woman
This is also relfected in the total bank depisits equalling the total govt debt..
The banks in the case of th individual sovereogn ....and central bank in the case of the govt are record keepers balancing the sum total of private deposits ..ie what thw record keeper owes the individial person ...and what the collective ie govt owes the banking system ...the banking system is the result and symptom of the individual deciding to lend all his labour to a debt recording system..
The growth of these deposits reflects the growht of govt ious ...
The surety of both being the soveregn ..
To get out of the debt game ..all the soveregn has to do is reduce debt at he treasury and collapse treasury bills ...
Govts cannot reduce debt created by the soveregn ..they only have the right goven by the soveregn and surety to admunsiter ie rollover the debt we as soveregn increaase at the banking system
When we reduce debt as sovereign we need to instruct the treasury to acknowledge our surety rights over it ..ie setoof all charges in out name ..
The treasury becomes our direct banker and insurer for a new zero debt game where we enSure and r thus surety to a debt reduction banking system

"I agree that the fractional reserve theory of banking is ridiculous. However, the financial intermediary theory of banking is also bunk. Banks create money out of nothing when they issue a loan. 97% of the money supply is bank credit denominated in the common unit of account. Base money, federally issued money, is created whenever the federal government spends into the private sector. Federal taxes are how base money is destroyed. Federal revenue is not a funding mechanism for the federal government and reserves never leave the reserve banking system. The neoliberal order believes that all money aught to be bank credit and push for balanced budget laws and fiscal surpluses. This is the hight of economic stupidity. Public sector debt is the only way for the private sector to net save.

"HELP! Hey, really great video. Thank you! I have some questions though, I would REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD ANSWER THEM. 

1. You say that if a bank expands too quickly it may not be able to pay out the money they have there, you mean the money they promised to lend out when they approved someone for a loan, correct? So where do banks get the money to pay their customers, from other commercial banks that lend to them? From the central bank always or initially? This is what confuses me. 

2. That first question seque ways to my second one. You mentioned banks have to keep a certain amount of their own money as reserves, was this money issued by the central bank to begin with, or was it money raised from investors? I’m assuming investors since you brought up that banks can issue new stock that the public can buy, but what about before it goes public? When the bank is private?

4. I’ve read a lot of financial articles on Real Clear Markets that point to the bond market actually keeping interest rates low because they are buying all of the safe and liquid collateral for repo, WHICH ARE treasuries. It goes on by saying the central bank actually buys SOME bonds, and that even if they try to increase rates at the lower end, the yield curve flattens because the rest of the bond market does not raise rates. Is this true? You pointed out the central bank is trying to encourage banks to lend, to no avail.. but I feel like there might be more to that point.

5. You say banks are required to hold liquid and cash rations, so is this set individually by countries or by the IMF, the World Bank?

6. IS THIS NARRATIVE ABOUT THE CENTRAL BANK CREATING INFLATION REALLY TRUE?
